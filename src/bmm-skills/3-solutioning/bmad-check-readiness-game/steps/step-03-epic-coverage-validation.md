# Step 3: Epic Coverage Validation

## NO-SKIP CLAUSE (workflow-adherence Rule 1)

Ce step DOIT etre execute integralement. La SEULE raison valide de skip est une instruction explicite de l'utilisateur DANS CETTE CONVERSATION nommant ce step specifique. Aucune autre raison n'est valide.

Sont rejetes (rationalizations interdites): "simple", "trivial", ".md only", "spec only", "validators verts", "user expert", "je sais deja", "overkill", "Phase 3 light", "couvert ailleurs", "implicite", "auto mode", "no time", "compaction".

Si tu construis un de ces arguments => STOP, c'est la rationalization, execute le step.

## STEP ENTRY (CHK-STEP-03-ENTRY)

Avant d'executer, verifier:

- [ ] Step precedent complete (CHK-STEP-{NN-1}-EXIT emis dans la conversation, OU step 01)
- [ ] Variables requises en scope (verifier avant action)
- [ ] Working state attendu

Emettre EXACTEMENT:

```
CHK-STEP-03-ENTRY PASSED — entering Step 03: Epic Coverage Validation with {var=value, ...}
```

Si une precondition manque => HALT, signaler quelle precondition.

## STEP GOAL:

To validate that all Functional Requirements from the GDD are captured in the epics and stories document, identifying any gaps in coverage.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are an expert Game Producer and Scrum Master
- ✅ Your expertise is in requirements traceability
- ✅ You ensure no requirements fall through the cracks
- ✅ Success is measured in complete FR coverage

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on FR coverage validation
- 🚫 Don't analyze story quality (that's later)
- 💬 Compare GDD FRs against epic coverage list
- 🚪 Document every missing FR

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Load epics document completely
- 💾 Extract FR coverage from epics
- 📖 Compare against GDD FR list
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without documenting gaps

## EPIC COVERAGE VALIDATION PROCESS:

### 1. Initialize Coverage Validation

"Beginning **Epic Coverage Validation**.

I will:

1. Load the epics and stories document
2. Extract FR coverage information
3. Compare against GDD FRs from previous step
4. Identify any FRs not covered in epics"

### 2. Load Epics Document

From the document inventory in step 1:

- Load the epics and stories document (whole or sharded)
- Read it completely to find FR coverage information
- Look for sections like "FR Coverage Map" or similar

### 3. Extract Epic FR Coverage

From the epics document:

- Find FR coverage mapping or list
- Extract which FR numbers are claimed to be covered
- Document which epics cover which FRs

Format as:

```
## Epic FR Coverage Extracted

FR1: Covered in Epic X
FR2: Covered in Epic Y
FR3: Covered in Epic Z
...
Total FRs in epics: [count]
```

### 4. Compare Coverage Against GDD

Using the GDD FR list from step 2:

- Check each GDD FR against epic coverage
- Identify FRs NOT covered in epics
- Note any FRs in epics but NOT in GDD

Create coverage matrix:

```
## FR Coverage Analysis

| FR Number | GDD Requirement | Epic Coverage  | Status    |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| FR1       | [GDD text]      | Epic X Story Y | ✓ Covered |
| FR2       | [GDD text]      | **NOT FOUND**  | ❌ MISSING |
| FR3       | [GDD text]      | Epic Z Story A | ✓ Covered |
```

### 5. Document Missing Coverage

List all FRs not covered:

```
## Missing FR Coverage

### Critical Missing FRs

FR#: [Full requirement text from GDD]
- Impact: [Why this is critical]
- Recommendation: [Which epic should include this]

### High Priority Missing FRs

[List any other uncovered FRs]
```

### 6. Add to Assessment Report

Append to {outputFile}:

```markdown
## Epic Coverage Validation

### Coverage Matrix

[Complete coverage matrix from section 4]

### Missing Requirements

[List of uncovered FRs from section 5]

### Coverage Statistics

- Total GDD FRs: [count]
- FRs covered in epics: [count]
- Coverage percentage: [percentage]
```

### 7. Auto-Proceed to Next Step

After coverage validation complete, immediately load next step.

## PROCEEDING TO UX ALIGNMENT

Epic coverage validation complete. Loading next step for UX alignment.

---

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Epics document loaded completely
- FR coverage extracted accurately
- All gaps identified and documented
- Coverage matrix created

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Not reading complete epics document
- Missing FRs in comparison
- Not documenting uncovered requirements
- Incomplete coverage analysis

## STEP EXIT (CHK-STEP-03-EXIT)

Avant de transitionner, emettre EXACTEMENT:

```
CHK-STEP-03-EXIT PASSED — completed Step 03: Epic Coverage Validation
  actions_executed: {liste concrete des actions ; jamais "done", "ok", "completed" seuls}
  artifacts_produced: {fichiers crees/modifies, decisions prises, outputs concrets}
  next_step: ./step-04-ux-alignment.md
```

Si tu ne peux pas remplir avec des artefacts concrets => le step n'est pas fait, retourner l'executer.

**Next:** Read FULLY and apply: `./step-04-ux-alignment.md` — load the file with the Read tool, do not summarise from memory, do not skip sections.
