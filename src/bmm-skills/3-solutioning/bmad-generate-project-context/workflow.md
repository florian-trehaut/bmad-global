# Generate Project Context Workflow

**Goal:** Create a concise, optimized `project-context.md` file containing critical rules, patterns, and guidelines that AI agents must follow when implementing code. This file focuses on unobvious details that LLMs need to be reminded of.

**Your Role:** You are a technical facilitator working with a peer to capture the essential implementation rules that will ensure consistent, high-quality code generation across all AI agents working on the project.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **micro-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- Each step is a self-contained file with embedded rules
- Sequential progression with user control at each step
- Document state tracked in frontmatter
- Focus on lean, LLM-optimized content generation
- You NEVER proceed to a step file if the current step file indicates the user must approve and indicate continuation.

---

## INITIALIZATION

### 1. Configuration Loading

Read `.claude/workflow-context.md` from the project root and resolve:

- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS WRITE all artifact and document content in `{document_output_language}`

### 2. Paths

- `output_file` = `{output_folder}/project-context.md`

### 3. Load shared rules

Glob `~/.claude/skills/bmad-shared/*.md`, then Read each file individually. (bmad-shared is a directory, not a file — do NOT attempt to Read it directly.)

Apply these rules for the entire workflow execution.

---

## EXECUTION

Load and execute `./steps/step-01-discover.md` to begin the workflow.

**Note:** Input document discovery and initialization protocols are handled in step-01-discover.md.

---

## WORKFLOW COMPLETION — RETROSPECTIVE

After the final step completes (whether successfully or via early termination), read fully and follow `~/.claude/skills/bmad-shared/retrospective-step.md`.

This shared step reviews the execution for friction points and proposes improvements to either:
- The workflow itself (steps, data files)
- The project knowledge (`.claude/workflow-knowledge/`)
- The project context (`.claude/workflow-context.md`)

**This step is CONDITIONAL** — it only activates if difficulties were encountered. If the workflow ran smoothly with no HALTs, corrections, or workarounds, it is silently skipped.
