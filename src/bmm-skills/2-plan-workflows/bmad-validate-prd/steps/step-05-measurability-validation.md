# Step 5: Measurability Validation

## STEP GOAL

Validate that all Functional Requirements (FRs) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) are measurable, testable, and follow proper format without implementation details.

## RULES

- Focus ONLY on FR and NFR measurability
- This step runs autonomously -- no user input needed, auto-proceeds when complete
- Validate each requirement individually, not in aggregate
- Attempt subprocess first, fall back to direct analysis if unavailable

## SEQUENCE

### 1. Attempt Sub-Process Validation

Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:

"Perform measurability validation on this PRD:

**Functional Requirements (FRs):**
1. Extract all FRs from Functional Requirements section
2. Check each FR for:
   - '[Actor] can [capability]' format compliance
   - No subjective adjectives (easy, fast, simple, intuitive, etc.)
   - No vague quantifiers (multiple, several, some, many, etc.)
   - No implementation details (technology names, library names, data structures unless capability-relevant)
3. Document violations with line numbers

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**
1. Extract all NFRs from Non-Functional Requirements section
2. Check each NFR for:
   - Specific metrics with measurement methods
   - Template compliance (criterion, metric, measurement method, context)
   - Context included (why this matters, who it affects)
3. Document violations with line numbers

Return structured findings with violation counts and examples."

### 2. Direct Analysis (if Task tool unavailable)

If Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:

**Functional Requirements Analysis:**

Extract all FRs and check each for:

**Format compliance:**
- Does it follow "[Actor] can [capability]" pattern?
- Is actor clearly defined?
- Is capability actionable and testable?

**No subjective adjectives:**
- Scan for: easy, fast, simple, intuitive, user-friendly, responsive, quick, efficient (without metrics)
- Note line numbers

**No vague quantifiers:**
- Scan for: multiple, several, some, many, few, various, number of
- Note line numbers

**No implementation details:**
- Scan for: React, Vue, Angular, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Redux, etc.
- Unless capability-relevant (e.g., "API consumers can access...")
- Note line numbers

**Non-Functional Requirements Analysis:**

Extract all NFRs and check each for:

**Specific metrics:**
- Is there a measurable criterion? (e.g., "response time < 200ms", not "fast response")
- Can this be measured or tested?

**Template compliance:**
- Criterion defined?
- Metric specified?
- Measurement method included?
- Context provided?

### 3. Tally Violations

**FR Violations:**
- Format violations: count
- Subjective adjectives: count
- Vague quantifiers: count
- Implementation leakage: count
- Total FR violations: sum

**NFR Violations:**
- Missing metrics: count
- Incomplete template: count
- Missing context: count
- Total NFR violations: sum

**Total violations:** FR violations + NFR violations

### 4. Report Measurability Findings to Validation Report

Append to validation report:

```markdown
## Measurability Validation

### Functional Requirements

**Total FRs Analyzed:** {count}

**Format Violations:** {count}
[If violations exist, list examples with line numbers]

**Subjective Adjectives Found:** {count}
[If found, list examples with line numbers]

**Vague Quantifiers Found:** {count}
[If found, list examples with line numbers]

**Implementation Leakage:** {count}
[If found, list examples with line numbers]

**FR Violations Total:** {total}

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Total NFRs Analyzed:** {count}

**Missing Metrics:** {count}
[If missing, list examples with line numbers]

**Incomplete Template:** {count}
[If incomplete, list examples with line numbers]

**Missing Context:** {count}
[If missing, list examples with line numbers]

**NFR Violations Total:** {total}

### Overall Assessment

**Total Requirements:** {FRs + NFRs}
**Total Violations:** {FR violations + NFR violations}

**Severity:** [Critical if >10 violations, Warning if 5-10, Pass if <5]

**Recommendation:**
[If Critical] "Many requirements are not measurable or testable. Requirements must be revised to be testable for downstream work."
[If Warning] "Some requirements need refinement for measurability. Focus on violating requirements above."
[If Pass] "Requirements demonstrate good measurability with minimal issues."
```

### 5. Display Progress and Auto-Proceed

Display: "**Measurability Validation Complete**

Total Violations: {count} ({severity})

**Proceeding to next validation check...**"
