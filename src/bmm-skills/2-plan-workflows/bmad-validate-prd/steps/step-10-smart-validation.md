# Step 10: SMART Requirements Validation

## STEP GOAL

Validate Functional Requirements meet SMART quality criteria (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Traceable), ensuring high-quality requirements.

## RULES

- Focus ONLY on FR quality assessment using SMART framework
- Score each FR on all 5 criteria using 1-5 scale
- Flag any FR with score < 3 in any category
- This step runs autonomously -- no user input needed, auto-proceeds when complete

## SEQUENCE

### 1. Extract All Functional Requirements

From the PRD's Functional Requirements section, extract:
- All FRs with their FR numbers (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- Count total FRs

### 2. Attempt Sub-Process Validation

Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:

"Perform SMART requirements validation on these Functional Requirements:

{List all FRs}

**For each FR, score on SMART criteria (1-5 scale):**

**Specific (1-5):**
- 5: Clear, unambiguous, well-defined
- 3: Somewhat clear but could be more specific
- 1: Vague, ambiguous, unclear

**Measurable (1-5):**
- 5: Quantifiable metrics, testable
- 3: Partially measurable
- 1: Not measurable, subjective

**Attainable (1-5):**
- 5: Realistic, achievable with constraints
- 3: Probably achievable but uncertain
- 1: Unrealistic, technically infeasible

**Relevant (1-5):**
- 5: Clearly aligned with user needs and business objectives
- 3: Somewhat relevant but connection unclear
- 1: Not relevant, doesn't align with goals

**Traceable (1-5):**
- 5: Clearly traces to user journey or business objective
- 3: Partially traceable
- 1: Orphan requirement, no clear source

**For each FR with score < 3 in any category:**
- Provide specific improvement suggestions

Return scoring table with all FR scores and improvement suggestions for low-scoring FRs."

If no Task tool, manually score each FR on SMART criteria, note low scores, provide improvement suggestions.

### 3. Build Scoring Table

For each FR:
- FR number
- Specific score (1-5)
- Measurable score (1-5)
- Attainable score (1-5)
- Relevant score (1-5)
- Traceable score (1-5)
- Average score
- Flag if any category < 3

Calculate overall FR quality:
- Percentage of FRs with all scores >= 3
- Percentage of FRs with all scores >= 4
- Average score across all FRs and categories

### 4. Report SMART Findings to Validation Report

Append to validation report:

```markdown
## SMART Requirements Validation

**Total Functional Requirements:** {count}

### Scoring Summary

**All scores >= 3:** {percentage}% ({count}/{total})
**All scores >= 4:** {percentage}% ({count}/{total})
**Overall Average Score:** {average}/5.0

### Scoring Table

| FR # | Specific | Measurable | Attainable | Relevant | Traceable | Average | Flag |
|------|----------|------------|------------|----------|-----------|--------|------|
| FR-001 | {s1} | {m1} | {a1} | {r1} | {t1} | {avg1} | {X if any <3} |
| FR-002 | {s2} | {m2} | {a2} | {r2} | {t2} | {avg2} | {X if any <3} |
[Continue for all FRs]

**Legend:** 1=Poor, 3=Acceptable, 5=Excellent
**Flag:** X = Score < 3 in one or more categories

### Improvement Suggestions

**Low-Scoring FRs:**

**FR-{number}:** {specific suggestion for improvement}
[For each FR with score < 3 in any category]

### Overall Assessment

**Severity:** [Critical if >30% flagged FRs, Warning if 10-30%, Pass if <10%]

**Recommendation:**
[If Critical] "Many FRs have quality issues. Revise flagged FRs using SMART framework to improve clarity and testability."
[If Warning] "Some FRs would benefit from SMART refinement. Focus on flagged requirements above."
[If Pass] "Functional Requirements demonstrate good SMART quality overall."
```
