# Step 4: Product Brief Coverage Validation

## STEP GOAL

Validate that PRD covers all content from Product Brief (if brief was used as input), mapping brief content to PRD sections and identifying gaps.

## RULES

- Conditional step: skip if no Product Brief exists in input documents
- Focus ONLY on Product Brief coverage mapping
- This step runs autonomously -- no user input needed, auto-proceeds when complete
- Attempt subprocess first, fall back to direct analysis if unavailable

## SEQUENCE

### 1. Check for Product Brief

Check if Product Brief was loaded in step 1's inputDocuments.

**IF no Product Brief found:**
Append to validation report:
```markdown
## Product Brief Coverage

**Status:** N/A - No Product Brief was provided as input
```

Display: "**Product Brief Coverage: Skipped** (No Product Brief provided)

**Proceeding to next validation check...**"

Without delay, read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}

**IF Product Brief exists:** Continue to step 2 below.

### 2. Attempt Sub-Process Validation

Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:

"Perform Product Brief coverage validation:

1. Load the Product Brief
2. Extract key content: vision statement, target users/personas, problem statement, key features, goals/objectives, differentiators, constraints
3. For each item, search PRD for corresponding coverage
4. Classify coverage: Fully Covered / Partially Covered / Not Found / Intentionally Excluded
5. Note any gaps with severity: Critical / Moderate / Informational

Return structured coverage map with classifications."

### 3. Direct Analysis (if Task tool unavailable)

If Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:

**Extract from Product Brief:**
- Vision: What is this product?
- Users: Who is it for?
- Problem: What problem does it solve?
- Features: What are the key capabilities?
- Goals: What are the success criteria?
- Differentiators: What makes it unique?

**For each item, search PRD:**
- Scan Executive Summary for vision
- Check User Journeys or user personas
- Look for problem statement
- Review Functional Requirements for features
- Check Success Criteria section
- Search for differentiators

**Classify coverage:**
- **Fully Covered:** Content present and complete
- **Partially Covered:** Content present but incomplete
- **Not Found:** Content missing from PRD
- **Intentionally Excluded:** Content explicitly out of scope

### 4. Assess Coverage and Severity

For each gap (Partially Covered or Not Found):
- Is this Critical? (Core vision, primary users, main features)
- Is this Moderate? (Secondary features, some goals)
- Is this Informational? (Nice-to-have features, minor details)

Note: Some exclusions may be intentional (valid scoping decisions).

### 5. Report Coverage Findings to Validation Report

Append to validation report:

```markdown
## Product Brief Coverage

**Product Brief:** {brief_file_name}

### Coverage Map

**Vision Statement:** [Fully/Partially/Not Found/Intentionally Excluded]
[If gap: Note severity and specific missing content]

**Target Users:** [Fully/Partially/Not Found/Intentionally Excluded]
[If gap: Note severity and specific missing content]

**Problem Statement:** [Fully/Partially/Not Found/Intentionally Excluded]
[If gap: Note severity and specific missing content]

**Key Features:** [Fully/Partially/Not Found/Intentionally Excluded]
[If gap: List specific features with severity]

**Goals/Objectives:** [Fully/Partially/Not Found/Intentionally Excluded]
[If gap: Note severity and specific missing content]

**Differentiators:** [Fully/Partially/Not Found/Intentionally Excluded]
[If gap: Note severity and specific missing content]

### Coverage Summary

**Overall Coverage:** [percentage or qualitative assessment]
**Critical Gaps:** [count] [list if any]
**Moderate Gaps:** [count] [list if any]
**Informational Gaps:** [count] [list if any]

**Recommendation:**
[If critical gaps exist] "PRD should be revised to cover critical Product Brief content."
[If moderate gaps] "Consider addressing moderate gaps for complete coverage."
[If minimal gaps] "PRD provides good coverage of Product Brief content."
```
